# Connect a client to app-server

Use app-server when building a client that needs to manage sessions, stream turns,
or control runs. For a script that only submits a task and captures its result,
[`wuu exec`](exec.md) provides that lifecycle already.

## Start the process

```bash
wuu app-server --workdir /path/to/project
```

Keep stdin and stdout connected to your client. Each protocol message is a JSON
object on one line; stdout is the protocol stream, so keep process diagnostics
separate. The server uses local configuration unless you supply an explicit
`--config` file. `--safe-mode` starts without activating plugins for recovery.

Send `initialize` first:

```json
{"id":"1","method":"initialize","params":{"protocol_version":"wuu-app-server/v0.1","client":{"name":"example-client"}}}
```

Responses carry the same `id` and either `result` or `error`. Notifications have
`method` and `params` without an `id`. Check initialization's `status` and `issues`:
a successful protocol response can still report `needs_setup`.

## Run a task

Create a session, then use the returned `result.thread.id`:

```json
{"id":"2","method":"thread/start","params":{}}
{"id":"3","method":"run/start","params":{"thread_id":"THREAD_ID","prompt":"summarize this repository","request":{"mode":"start"}}}
```

These are sequential requests, not a batch to paste unchanged: replace `THREAD_ID`
with the actual ID after the first response. Keep reading notifications until
`run/updated` reports a terminal status for the returned run ID. A `run/start`
response means the run was admitted, not that the task completed.

Interactive clients can use `turn/start` instead, consuming turn and item updates.
Automation runs can include several continuation or schema-correction turns,
so `turn/completed` alone does not settle a run. Use `run/interrupt` to stop a run,
and request `shutdown` before closing a client-owned server.

## Reuse a session

`thread/resume` takes `session_id`; omitting it selects the most recent visible
session in the workspace. `thread/fork` takes `thread_id` and creates a separate
conversation. `thread/start` with `ephemeral: true` creates an in-memory session
that cannot be resumed after the server exits.

A conversation keeps its own model and permission selection. Change it through
`config/model/update` with `thread_id` while the conversation is idle. This does
not change workspace defaults. A busy conversation returns `thread_busy`, allowing
the client to wait and retry. A request without `thread_id` updates defaults
for future conversations. Do not try to override a turn's permission mode through
`turn/start`.

## Probe the protocol

```bash
wuu debug app-server initialize --workdir /path/to/project
wuu debug app-server send --workdir /path/to/project config/read '{}'
```

Each debug command starts a server, performs the request, and shuts it down. Use a
long-lived client for streamed execution rather than chaining independent probes.

The stdio protocol is a trusted local control surface, not an authenticated network
service. A remote or hosted deployment must provide its own transport security and
isolation around it. The [protocol reference](../integrations/app-server-protocol.md)
covers message shapes, capabilities, selection rules, and cloud process identity.
